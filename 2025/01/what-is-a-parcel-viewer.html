        <h3>What is a Parcel Viewer?</h3>
        <p>A Parcel Viewer is an interactive map that allows you to find and inspect a specific piece of land. It is
            fundamentally a
            tool that allows you to explore properties, compare them, and identify specific properties of interest to
            you. Property parcels in Washington State are assigned a unique Id by the County Assessor’s
            office, this is often called a parcel number. The pieces of land outlined on the map in a Parcel Viewer have
            no legal meaning, rather there is a legal description of a parcel from which the County Assessor’s office
            can
            work out the boundaries of the parcel based on this description in combination with the plat document that
            defined the parcel and the most recent survey documents.
        </p>
        <a href="ParcelViewerExample.webp" title="Selecting a specific parcel using the King County Parcel Viewer."><img
                src="ParcelViewerExample.webp"
                alt="Selecting a specific parcel using the King County Parcel Viewer."></a>
        <p>In Washington State the most recent survey is the truth as Professional Land Surveyors are licensed by the
            State to provide a specific, binding interpretation of the boundaries of a parcel. Although surveyors are
            not public employees their work is often treated as the position of the government by all the other parties
            involved in the process like the Assessor, Treasurer, Recorder, mortgage and title companies, and permitting
            departments. This is why it’s important for a Parcel Viewer to show you not just the outline of a parcel,
            but also the supporting materials that define the parcel including the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">plat documents</a>
            and <a href="https://brpels.wa.gov/dont-cut-corners" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">surveys</a>
            related to
            it.</p>
        <p>The Assessor maintains the parcels and handles splits, merges, and the creation of new parcels. They assess
            property taxes on a yearly basis for every parcel in their County in compliance with State law. The
            collection of these taxes is handled by the County Treasurer. Most property taxes are paid on a yearly or
            bi-year basis by mortgage companies, but you can pay property taxes directly if you prefer or if you don’t
            have a mortgage. Changes in ownership are filed with the County Recorder along with payment of Washington
            State’s <a
                href="https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/executive-services/certificates-permits-licenses/records-licensing/recorders-office/real-estate-excise-tax"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Real Estate Excise Tax.</a> Each of these actions results in a
            document getting filed to record the
            event, which can then be linked from the Parcel you’re viewing.</p>
        <a href="ExampleParcelTabular.webp"
            title="Selecting a specific parcel using the King County Parcel Viewer and viewing related tabular data."><img
                src="ExampleParcelTabular.webp"
                alt="Selecting a specific parcel using the King County Parcel Viewer and viewing related tabular data."></a>
        <p>
            The coolest aspect of a Geographics Information System (GIS) is that you can find information and attributes
            related to a parcel based on its shape rather than some identifier like a number or a GUID. There are many
            different layers of information that can be added to a Parcel Viewer including hazards like flood zones,
            often a large polygon that overlaps many parcels, and political boundaries like school districts or voting
            precincts. The parcel has no direct link to the flood zones or the voting precincts and every layer
            is ignorant of the others. But we can use the outline of a parcel to see what layers overlap and then gather
            up the qualifying attributes of the overlapping layers to associate that information with our parcel.
        </p>
        <p>Often showing this kind of related information from a spatial query directly on a map can be confusing and
            hard to parse due to the density of the information. There are a couple of methods to solve this problem in
            a Parcel Viewer like placing a small table inside of a popup that appears when you click on a parcel.
            Alternatively, you can link from your parcel to another app or web page that presents this information as a
            table or series of tables. This is often found when the Assessor or Recorder is in a separately elected
            position (with its own IT staff) distinct from the elected officials that control the County’s IT or GIS
            groups. Personally, my favorite solution is to take the left third of the screen and use it as a scrollable
            column of tables containing this related information like Zillow or Redfin. This allows you to maintain the
            context of the map, quick switching between Parcel’s of interest, while getting the detailed tabular
            information in a decent visual format.</p>
        <a href="ExampleMetadata.webp" title="Good quality metadata for parcels in King County."><img
                src="ExampleMetadata.webp" alt="Good quality metadata for parcels in King County."></a>
        <p>I don’t want to belabor this but the most difficult aspect of building a good Parcel Viewer is maintaining
            the data. Certain layers like address points and parcels get updated on a daily or weekly basis and receive
            constant scrutiny. But other layers like environmental zones or political boundaries can become outdated due
            to staff turnover or political events. In software culture there are jokes about a lone bearded man
            maintaining a critical building block of computing that many larger and more powerful systems rely upon. The
            same sentiment applies to the maintenance of datasets in local government, there’s likely just one person,
            and if they retire before they can spend a couple years training a motivated replacement, it can
            significantly harm the quality of a Parcel Viewer.</p>
        <p>
            In sum an ideal Parcel Viewer contains these aspects:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A map 🗺️</li>
            <li>Exploration and Searching</li>
            <li>Links to related documents that legally define Parcels of interest like Plats and Surveys</li>
            <li>Property tax information</li>
            <li>Layers of related data queried by shape and displayed as tables for a specific Parcel</li>
            <li>Accurate and well-maintained data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you’re working on a Parcel Viewer and it doesn’t meet these requirements then you’re cooked. Cheap
            challenges aside, this set of criteria is as practical and necessary today as it was when I started building
            Parcel Viewers a decade ago. An Evergreen-state, as it were.
