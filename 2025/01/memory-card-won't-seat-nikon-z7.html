        <h3>The memory card won’t seat in my Nikon Z7</h3>
        <p>I have a Nikon Z7, last weekend I tried to swap out its memory card for another, but the memory card wouldn’t
            stay in the slot. It kept popping back out! How annoying. But I was lucky, if I closed the cover fast enough
            the card would stay in its slot and continue to work. It usually took a few tries, but it was good enough for the moment.
        </p>
        <a href="MemoryCardScrewAndTool.webp" title="The CF Express Type B memory card, the offending screw, and the paper clip pick used to remove it."><img
                src="MemoryCardScrewAndTool.webp"
                alt="The CF Express Type B memory card, the offending screw, and the paper clip pick used to remove it."></a>
        <p>After a bit of Googling and reading similar posts in the DPReview forums where the camera was sent back to
            Nikon, I decided to try fixing this problem myself. I have two Nikon Z7 bodies, so I was able to compare the
            function of the memory card slot side by side on my dining room table. I noticed that on my good camera the
            memory card slotted down until it was flush with body of the camera. But on the camera where the card
            wouldn’t stay inserted the top edge of the memory card floated a few millimeters above the edge. This was
            evidence that there was a physical problem with the slot.</p>
        <p>Using the light on my phone I illuminated the inside of the slot to inspect it for damage. Comparing my two
            cameras side by side everything looked normal. All the copper CFExpress Type B pins were still attached, and
            their plastic shrouds were square and parallel to each other. The green PCB on one side of the slot had no
            stains or visible damage and the same was true of the metal plate on the opposite wall of the slot. Nothing
            appeared amiss. </p>
        <a href="FindingTheScrew.webp"
            title="The screw that was keeping the memory card from seating in my Nikon Z7."><img
                src="FindingTheScrew.webp"
                alt="The screw that was keeping the memory card from seating in my Nikon Z7."></a>
        <p>
            In the far bottom corner of the memory card slot, I noticed a small spring. Based on its position I inferred
            that this was the retention spring that held the card in the slot and clicked when the card was correctly
            inserted in the slot. On my good camera there’s just empty space around this spring, but on my temperamental
            camera there was a single tiny screw that was sitting next to the spring. Finally, I’d found the culprit!
        </p>
        <p>At first, I tried just beating the camera. This was a failure. My repeated attempts at slotting the memory
            card into this slot had firmly wedged the small screw into the small spring. I needed a thin, precise
            picking tool of some sort. Lacking the correct surgical instruments, I found a paper clip in my kitchen junk
            drawer. I bent out the paper to form a long lever that I could use to reach down into the memory card slot
            and pick out the screw.</p>
        <a href="PaperclipInTheMemoryCardSlot.webp" title="Using a paper clip as a pick to remove a floating screw from the memory card slot of my Nikon Z7."><img
                src="PaperclipInTheMemoryCardSlot.webp" alt="Using a paper clip as a pick to remove a floating screw from the memory card slot of my Nikon Z7."></a>
        <p>
            The screw was freed and moved around the first time I touched it. I was elated. But the clearances are very
            tight between the spring and the wall around it. Even with the screw freed, shaking the camera and banging
            on it weren’t enough to get the screw to fall free using gravity. It was also difficult, due to the depth of
            the slot, to keep a light shined in there while trying to use the paper clip to pick at the screw. I solved
            this by holding the camera over the top of a lamp fixture so that the light would shine directly up from the
            lamp and into the card slot while I held it in air. After a few more attempts of picking at the screw it
            suddenly felt out and into the palm of my hand.
        </p>
        <p>With the physical blockage cleared the memory card seated perfectly into the body of my Nikon Z7. All was now
            well in this small part of the world.
