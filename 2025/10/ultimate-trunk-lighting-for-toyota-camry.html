        <h3>The Ultimate Trunk Lighting for a Toyota Camry</h3>
        <p>My 2012 Toyota Camry Hybrid XLE has only a single light fixture in the trunk. It’s equipped with the same
            7440 bulb as
            the puddle lights in the front doors and the dome lights above the front windshield. Toyota in their great
            and endless wisdom felt that a single bulb could light the trunk when four bulbs were required to light an
            area of the same width, length, and a similar volume in the front. I am here to tell you that Toyota was
            wrong, and the dark depths of that trunk made it easy to lose things in.
        </p>
        <a href="camrystock.webp"
            title="The single bulb that comes in the trunk isn't even bright enough to prevent my iPhone from automatically triggering its flash."><img
                src="camrystock.webp"
                alt="The single bulb that comes in the trunk isn't even bright enough to prevent my iPhone from automatically triggering its flash."></a>

        <p>I set out on a quest to bathe this shadow-cursed land with the light of the moon. The first problem was that
            I only had one light socket to work with. In prior cars that I’ve owned there’s typically a light on both
            the right and left sides of the cargo area and another light on the underside of the trunk lid or hatch.
            None of those locations are available in the Camry as the sole light fixture is dead center in the trunk
            directly under the rear deck. We’ve gotta work with what we’ve got, so I started by installing a higher
            output light into the T10 socket.</p>
        <a href="camryLargerBulb.webp"
            title="Using a larger 194 T10 2700k LED bulb from SEALIGHT off of Amazon."><img
                src="camryLargerBulb.webp"
                alt="Using a larger 194 T10 2700k LED bulb from SEALIGHT off of Amazon."></a>
        <p>This was better, but more than anything it just clarified how uneven and limited the lighting in the trunk
            really was. I started poking around on Amazon to look for alternatives like a larger corn-cob style LED
            light or a flat panel style that would add more surface area and output to the light fixture. What I found
            was even better, a 10-inch strip of conventional 12-volt LEDs like you would use in a house to light a room
            or in a kitchen for under cabinet lighting that came along with a socket adapter to convert from the car’s
            12-volt T10 socket to the 12 volt 2 wire/2-pin setup that LED strips commonly use. This was a revelation as
            I could hook almost anything up to this; I was no longer limited to just stuffing the biggest bulb that I
            could into that socket.</p>
        <a href="camryadaptert10.webp"
            title="This cheap little T10 socket apater opens up a world of possible lighting solutions."><img
                src="camryadaptert10.webp"
                alt="This cheap little T10 socket apater opens up a world of possible lighting solutions."></a>
        <p>The kit was cheap, so I ordered it and stuck it in the car. It was a real improvement and everything in the
            trunk was clearly visible now. But I didn’t love the cold 6500k color temperature or how short strip of LEDs
            was. I scrouged up a pair waterproof 5000k LED strips left over from a project in my kitchen (I converted my
            12-volt lighting to 48-volt) and installed one on each side of the trunk for even, full-width, lighting
            solution. This produced a jaw droppingly bright trunk space perfect for disassembling a broken camp stove in
            the wilderness or merely finding that thing that rolled away while I was driving.
        </p>
        <a href="camryinstallfinal.webp"
            title="Here's the guts of the final install on the underside of the rear deck."><img
                src="camryinstallfinal.webp"
                alt="Here's the guts of the final install on the underside of the rear deck."></a>
        <p>And here's the final product:</p>
        <a href="camryfinal.webp"
            title="The final product is a well lit trunk where nothing is left to the imagination."><img
                src="camryfinal.webp"
                alt="The final product is a well lit trunk where nothing is left to the imagination."></a>
        <p>Using a COB style LED strip where the individual chips aren’t visible with a black PCB and a warmer 3000k
            color temperature are my only ideas for how this could be improved further, but I’m quite pleased with it as
            of now. I can see EVERYTHING in this trunk. ✨</p>
