        <h3>Updating Porsche Macan headlights to LEDs</h3>
        <a href="IMG_2947.JPG" title="Headlight pattern with all of the upgraded blubs installed."><img
                src="IMG_2947.JPG" alt="Headlight pattern with all of the upgraded blubs installed."></a>
        <p>Last year I purchased a 2016 Porsche Macan S. Many things about my Macan have aged well in the 6 years since
            it left the factory in Leipzig, Germany; but the decision to ship the car with mostly incandescent light
            bulbs was clearly a mistake. I remember thinking to myself as I was on the way to campsite deep in the
            forest that these low beams weren’t as strong as my prior car.</p>
        <p>There are two main advantages to replacing the stock light bulbs with LEDs: improved light output and reduced
            power consumption. For the same amount of power consumed by an incandescent light bulb LEDs can be up to 6
            times brighter. In most cases this efficiency improvement is split between increased light output measured
            in Lumens and reduced power consumption measured in Watts.</p>
        <p>The Macan’s cornering lights highlight the advantages of LEDs. These lights are a part of the headlight
            assembly and are activated when you turn the steering wheel more than a quarter of a revolution. Typically,
            this happens when making 90 degree or more turns at low speeds. A direct replacement of the OEM lightbulb is
            the Sylvania SilverStar ULTRA H7. This bulb claims to produce 1,571 Lumens at 55 Watts of power, and they
            cost $82. The replacement LED bulb that I chose is the DMEX H7 which claims 4,000 Lumens at 30 Watts for
            $42. Taking both claims at face value, the LED option is ~2.5x brighter while drawing 40% less power and
            being half the cost. Hard to say no to something that’s both cheaper and better.</p>
        <h3>Changing Color Temperature</h3>
        <a href="FoglightColorComparison.webp"
            title="Stock foig light on the left and the LED fog light on the right."><img
                src="FoglightColorComparison.webp"
                alt="Stock foig light on the left and the LED fog light on the right."></a>
        <p>There is a caveat though, which is that LEDs do not match the color temperature of most stock light bulbs.
            Typically, they will be 6500k or 6000k in color temperature which cooler or bluer looking than the stock
            lighting. For low beams and high beams, you can often find options between 6500k and 3000k where 4500k is
            close to neutral and 3000k is yellow. It’s a shame that we have not yet seen ARGB offerings for LED
            replacement bulbs in the way we have with indoor LED lighting where the color temperature is user
            configurable.</p>
        <p>For my Macan I found a set of bulbs to replace the low beams and high beams with a color temperature of 4300K
            as I prefer a more neutral white. The cornering lights are 6000K because there was only one option to choose
            from. The fog lights are 3000K as yellower lights are better in fog per <a
                href="https://www.caranddriver.com/car-accessories/a38451079/yellow-fog-lights/" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">Car and Driver</a> and they are so
            rarely used that I think it’ll be a bit of a party trick.</p>
        <p>Here’s where the comparison gets fun; let’s combine the light output and power consumption of the stock
            lighting based on incandescent replacement bulbs and compare those totals to the LEDs I installed in my
            Porsche.</p>
        <h3>Low/High Beams</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SYLVANIA-Intensity-Discharge-Headlight-Contains/dp/B01DYA2384"
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sylvania D3S SilverStar zXe</a> - 3.2k Lumen @ 35
                Watts per bulb</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07F6QJLHV/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DMEX
                    D3S</a> - 3.8k Lumen @ 35 Watts per bulb</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cornering Lights</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SYLVANIA-SilverStar-Performance-Replacement-Technology/dp/B0012ETPUE"
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sylvania SilverStar ULTRA H7 </a> - 1.6k Lumen @ 55
                Watts per bulb</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09Y8HN3HN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DMEX
                    H7</a> - 4k Lumen @ 30 Watts per bulb</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Fog Lights</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SYLVANIA-SilverStar-Performance-Replacement-Technology/dp/B008BE04C6"
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sylvania H11 SilverStar ULTRA</a> - 1.3k Lumen @ 55
                Watts per bulb</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B1Q3GJYY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DMEX
                    H11</a> - 2.5k Lumen @ 17 Watts per bulb</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It’s worth noting here that I am not including the running lights present in the headlight assembly because
            the four dots are already LEDs and non-replaceable. Additionally, I am not counting the running lights that
            sit below the headlight assembly as they are also a nonreplaceable strip of LEDs.</p>
        <a href="BlubComparison.webp" title="The better build quality of the LED fog light blub is clear."><img
                src="BlubComparison.webp" alt="The better build quality of the LED fog light blub is clear."></a>
        <h3>Totals</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Stock replacements - 12k Lumens @ 290 Watts</li>
            <li>My blubs - 20k Lumens @ 164 Watts</li>
            <li>63% more light output at 56% of the power consumption</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For the low/high beam bulb I used a HID replacement rather than an LED, because the LED options were all
            6500K in color temperature. Luckily for me those LED offerings claim similar performance; 4k Lumens for LED
            versus 3.8k for HID at the same 35 Watts of power consumption. I’m feeling charitable, so I’m calling this
            difference a rounding error and hand waving it away.</p>
        <p>You may have noticed that all the LED bulbs I picked were from the DMEX brand on Amazon. This is because I
            like the build quality and pricing of these products. I purchased the D3S bulbs first and had no troubles.
            Then I picked up the H11 fog lights and enjoyed the blue aluminum body, so I decided to round things out
            with the H7 bulbs. I’ll update this after the winter season is over, but they’ve worked as expected so far.
            Although I get the impression that all these LED brands are interchangeable as is common for sub $100 items
            on Amazon.</p>
