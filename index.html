    <h1>Thomas August Ryan</h1>
    <p>Hi! People call me Tom. I'm a tallish mid twenties white dude from the Northwest.</p>
    <p>Right now I'm working on a data connector that pulls data from an MS-SQL database, formats the data, submits it to a vendor's borderline undocumented REST API, and reports back to a logging system.</p>
    <h3>Parcel Details</h3>
    <p>Outside of projects, I maintain the County's public Parcel information system. Parcel Details is a webapp that allows anyone to look up a tax parcel. Plats Search is another webapp that allows you to look up survey and plat documents related to a tax parcel. </p>
    <p>Parcel Details was origially an ASP.NET 4 project that used rapid application development tools provided by a vendor to define its business logic and user interface. Since I took over it's maintaince, I've upgrade the project to .NET 4.7, lead a redesign of the user interface, rewrote the business logic and views to remove all dependencies on the vendors tools, and migrated the database calls from ADO.NET Datasets to an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) called Dapper.</p> 
    <p>What I'm most proud of is getting the average page wieght down from 6 MBs to less than 200 KBs. This was achieved despite the addition of a responsive CSS framework (Bootsrap 3.3.7), button icons, and a variety of new interactive features.</p>
    <h3>Plats Search</h3>
    <p>Plat Search is an ASP.NET Core 2.1 project that I wrote from the ground up. Razor pages are used to define the views, Bootstrap is used to style the views, and Entity Framework Core is the ORM.</p>
    <p>Getting a hold of Plat Records from most County's in Washington requies going through the records request process. Plats Search circumvents this process by allowing people to search for Plats related to a tax parcel and directly download scans of those source documents.</p>
    <h3>Other Stuff</h3>
    <p>Outside of my work I enjoy camping in the Olympics at sites like Lake Kushman, Deep Park, and the coastline around Lake Ozette. I'm also looking forward to ski season this winter.</p>
    <p>For fun I've reimagined Kitsap County's parcel viewer as a 3D web map built on top of <a href="https://github.com/uncheckederror/KitsapParcelViewer">the Mapbox.js library and the County's open data dumps.</a></p>
    <p>I also know a bit about photography. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/uncheckederror/">You can see my work on Flikr.</a> Right now I'm shooting with a Sony RX100 MKIV and gorilla pod.</p>
    <p>As of November 2018 I am the author of the top text result on Google for "How to install RAM". Although I don't write product reviews anymore, I still have a deep interest in computer hardware.</p>
    <p>I'm helping my dad rebuild his old pickup truck. You can see my project tracking <a href="https://github.com/uncheckederror/toyotapickup/issues">repo on GitHub.</a></p>
